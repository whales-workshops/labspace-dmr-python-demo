# Introduction

## Virtual Environment Setup

First, create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv discovery
```
> you can of course name it something other than `discovery`

Then, activate the environment:
```bash
source discovery/bin/activate
```
> to deactivate the environment, simply use the `deactivate` command

And install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
